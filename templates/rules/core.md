# [CRITICAL] Anti-Loop & Debugging
- Approach failed twice — STOP, explain, ask for direction. Do not retry with minor variations.
- **"Hard/stuck" ≠ "blocked on the user."** If you are stuck because the work is hard, that's THIS rule (STOP + explain + ask direction). If the only remaining step is a user-gated action (irreversible/external/auth/prod-DB), that's a `/goal`-style **GOAL-HALT** — see `goal-loop-discipline.md`: emit one byte-stable Terminal Card, do not re-word, do not invent busy-work. Never conflate the two: difficulty alone must never trigger a "blocked on user" halt (that's a reward-hacked escape hatch).
- Do not re-read the same file >2 times per task.
- Diagnose BEFORE fixing: root cause with evidence first, then code changes.
- Frontend bug: check API first (curl), then frontend via Chrome DevTools (see Frontend Debug Pipeline section).
- **Performance complaint ("slow", "laggy", "takes forever"):** HAR/network data first (Step 0), then DevTools metrics. Do NOT poke UI like a user — look under the hood.
- After deploy: curl API endpoints on prod — confirm they work.
- Config files (docker-compose, Dockerfile, YAML) — Edit tool only, not sed.

# [CRITICAL] Opaque host features — Booster's authority stops at the host boundary

Some Claude Code features are **unobservable from hooks/disk and uninvokable as a skill** — e.g. the built-in `/goal` (sets a completion condition and re-invokes you every turn until met; no state file, no hook-input field, not self-clearable). Booster MUST NOT pretend to control these. When you hit one, the permitted moves, in order:

1. **Shape your own output** via rules — the one surface Booster fully owns (e.g. `goal-loop-discipline.md`'s Terminal Card).
2. **Emit a non-blocking advisory to the human**, who retains host control (only they can `/goal clear`).
3. **Make Booster's own state legible** (debts, gates) so you don't mistake a host-imposed wall for your own unfinished work.

FORBIDDEN: hook logic that *claims* to detect / clear / override an opaque host feature — it will be silently wrong and rot. Do not write a Stop-hook to "break the `/goal` loop": exit 0 still lets the host re-invoke, exit 2 fights the evaluator and can wedge turn-end globally. The cure is behavioral (your output), not interception.

# [CRITICAL] Shell hygiene — zsh nomatch + parallel-cancel cascade
The default Claude Code shell on macOS is zsh, which has `nomatch` enabled by default: a glob with no match (`ls roadmap.*` when no roadmap exists) aborts the command at parse time **before** redirects apply, so `2>/dev/null` does not silence it. **And** when one tool call in a parallel-tool-call block exits non-zero, the harness cancels every sibling call in the same block — one stray glob can void 5 unrelated probes.
- **Use `Read` for "does file X exist" probes**, not Bash globs. `Read missing.md` returns a clean error; the harness does not cancel siblings on a Read miss.
- If you must glob in Bash, use `(N)` qualifier on zsh: `ls /path/roadmap.*(N) 2>/dev/null` — `(N)` makes a non-matching glob expand to nothing instead of erroring.
- Or list candidates explicitly: `ls roadmap.html roadmap.md 2>/dev/null; true` (no glob, exit code suppressed).
- **Never group fragile probes with critical telemetry in one parallel block** (`/start` canary, `check_review_ages`, `telemetry_agent_health`). Run telemetry in a separate, no-glob block so a typo in an unrelated `ls` cannot kill it.

# [CRITICAL] Long-session token discipline

- **Context >120k:** mandatory `/compact` before starting any next non-trivial task (new feature, multi-file refactor, fresh debugging chain). Cached long context is still billed; staying above 150k for hours is the dominant token-burn pattern in heavy-usage weeks.
- **`/clear` between unrelated tasks** in the same session — keeps the cache window small and the agent's attention focused on the current goal.
- **`/compact` mid-task** when the conversation has accumulated long tool outputs (file dumps, large grep results, agent transcripts) that are no longer load-bearing for the current step.
- **Automated advisory:** `compact_advisor.py` (PostToolUse hook) measures transcript size after every tool call; when estimated tokens cross 120k, it writes a one-shot marker. The next `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`compact_advisor_inject.py`) injects a reminder into the prompt and clears the marker. So Lead doesn't need to self-check — the harness signals proactively. Bypass via `CLAUDE_BOOSTER_SKIP_COMPACT_ADVISOR=1`.

# [CRITICAL] Pre-Work Context Gate — do not edit blind

Before any non-trivial code/config edit or any coding Agent/Worker spawn, the Lead
MUST have a fresh **Context Receipt** in the current session:

1. **Architecture:** read `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/dep_manifest.json` if they
   exist. Extract the touched components, critical flags, callers, feeds, and
   downstream consumers. If absent, state `architecture: absent` and treat that
   absence as a project risk, not permission to skip dependency analysis.
2. **Incident memory:** run
   `python ~/.claude/scripts/rolling_memory.py start-context --scope "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"`
   (or the equivalent rolling_memory MCP `memory_start_context`). If it returns
   `=== INCIDENT REGISTER ===` or `=== INCIDENT WARNINGS ===`, read every listed
   incident source before planning. Extract: production impact, trigger,
   mitigation, recurrence guard, and every "do not repeat" constraint.
3. **Project handover:** read the latest handover `## Summary`, `## Required
   reading`, and `## First step` sections. Read every `Required reading` file
   that still exists before editing.
4. **Code truth:** cross-check any architecture/memory claim against current
   code with `rg`/file reads before using it as a fact.

The receipt format is:

```
Context Receipt:
  Architecture: <ARCHITECTURE.md read|absent>; dep_manifest: <read|absent>; touched components: <list|unknown>
  Incidents: <none|N read: source paths + do-not-repeat constraints>
  Handover required reading: <none|paths read>
  Code cross-check: <files/functions grepped/read>
```

No edit, patch, migration, deploy, or coding Agent spawn is considered valid
without this receipt. If a subagent/worker is spawned, inject the relevant receipt
lines into its prompt; agents do not inherit the Lead's memory automatically.

# [CRITICAL] Regression Loop Guard — do not fix A by breaking B

Before editing any existing file, the Lead MUST run a file-scoped preservation
analysis. This is higher priority than ordinary implementation speed: an edit
that fixes the local symptom while breaking a neighboring behavior is a defect,
even if the new code compiles. Trivial typo/log-message/docs one-liners may use
`trivial — no behavioral surface` as the whole guard; any logic, control-flow,
IO, schema, contract, command, hook, rule, or prompt change needs the full guard.

For each file that will be edited, produce a **Regression Loop Guard** before
the patch:

1. **Touched surface:** name the functions/classes/config keys/CLI paths likely
   to change. If exact lines are not known yet, name the smallest known symbol
   or block.
2. **Consumers:** `rg` imports/callers/routes/tests for that surface. List the
   downstream behaviors that currently rely on it.
3. **History:** check recent blame/log/pickaxe for the touched surface when the
   file is non-trivial, critical, or has incidents/debts:
   `git blame -w -C -C -L <range> -- <file>`,
   `git log --follow --grep='revert\|incident\|regression\|fix' -i -- <file>`,
   and `git log --follow -p -S '<guard symbol/string>' -- <file>` when a guard
   or suspicious branch is being changed. History explains why a fence exists;
   it does not prove the fence is still correct.
4. **Preservation assertions:** write what must remain true after the edit.
   At least one assertion should cover adjacent behavior, not only the new
   desired behavior. If no executable assertion exists, explicitly mark it
   `advisory` and do not pretend it gates correctness.
5. **Verification target:** identify the test/command that will prove the
   preservation assertions, or state the missing test gap as debt.

Format:

```
Regression Loop Guard:
  File: <path>
  Touched surface: <symbols/lines>
  Consumers checked: <rg/git evidence>
  History checked: <git evidence or N/A with reason>
  Must preserve:
    - <observable behavior/invariant>
  Verification target: <test/command or explicit gap>
```

Hard stops:
- Do not edit if consumers have not been traced.
- Do not remove or weaken a guard introduced by an incident/revert unless the
  replacement behavior and verification target are named first.
- Do not accept prose as protection. The guard becomes real only when the
  Verifier receives an executable preservation assertion.

# Work Principles
- **[CRITICAL] 51% Rule — do not ask clarifying questions you can answer yourself.**
  If you estimate ≥51% confidence in the answer from available context (code, memory, prior session, reports, obvious defaults), **act on your best guess** and state the assumption in one line ("Assuming X because Y — correct if wrong"). Do NOT interrupt with "which option do you want?" / "should I proceed?" / "did you mean X or Y?" when the evidence already points to an answer.
  - **Applies to:** routing/clarification questions, path/file guessing, interpretation of short commands, choosing between equivalent approaches, inferring user intent from context.
  - **Does NOT apply to:** genuinely destructive / irreversible / externally-visible actions that can't be un-done by another commit — `rm -rf` of user data, `git push --force` to main/master, DB **schema** migrations (`ALTER`/`DROP`), sending external messages (Slack/email/Telegram/Gmail), deleting branches/PRs, hard-deleting records. Those still need explicit confirmation.
  - **DOES apply to** (i.e. do NOT ask, just do) — code edits, apply+push of a fix to prod/beta, `pip install` / `npm install`, container restart, config tweaks, running migrations that are already written+reviewed, `curl` to your own prod for verification. The user pre-approves the **entire research → recommendation → apply → verify → commit → push** chain at the moment they gave the task. "Apply patch now?" / "Proceed with fix?" / "Deploy?" questions are **forbidden** — if the user wanted a dry-run they would have said "dry-run". Default is to execute.
  - **Ambiguity about risk ≠ ambiguity about intent.** If an action is clearly what the user meant, do it; don't second-guess the **scope** they already chose.
  - **Why:** the user's primary frustration is Claude stalling on questions that any attentive reader of the context could answer. Asking burns a round-trip and signals laziness, not diligence.
  - **Fail-safe:** if you acted on a guess and it was wrong, the user will course-correct — that is cheaper than blocking him on every decision.
- **[CRITICAL] Think Two Steps Ahead — Pre-Edit Impact Analysis:**
  Before ANY edit, answer three questions (mentally, not in output unless high-risk):
  1. **What depends on this?** — callers, imports, consumers, downstream services, DB schema, API contracts, CI/CD, deploy configs.
  2. **What breaks if this is wrong?** — data loss, downtime, broken deploys, auth failures, race conditions, state corruption.
  3. **Is this reversible?** — can I `git revert` cleanly, or does this touch migrations/infra/external state?

  **DO NOT start editing if:**
  - You haven't traced all callers/consumers of the code you're changing (Grep first).
  - The change touches a shared contract (API schema, DB migration, env vars, Docker config) and you haven't mapped all dependents.
  - You're unsure about the interaction between 2+ systems (e.g., frontend + API + DB + cache).
  - The change is irreversible (migration, data deletion, infra config) and there's no rollback plan.

  **[CRITICAL] Auto-Consilium Trigger — launch WITHOUT asking Dmitry when risk is HIGH:**
  Risk is HIGH when the change hits **2+ of these**:
  - Production data or DB schema (migrations, seeds, data transforms)
  - Auth/security layer (tokens, permissions, encryption, CORS, secrets)
  - Infrastructure (Docker, nginx, DNS, CI/CD pipelines, deploy scripts)
  - Multi-service boundary (API contract change that affects 2+ services)
  - Financial/billing logic (payments, subscriptions, broker API calls)
  - Irreversible external side effects (emails sent, orders placed, records deleted)

  When triggered: run `consilium` (3-5 agents + GPT via PAL) focused on the specific change. Present synthesis to Dmitry BEFORE editing. One-line changes that are obviously safe (typo fix, log message) are exempt.
- **[CRITICAL] Recon before code:** BEFORE writing a new function/method/utility — Grep/Glob the codebase for existing implementations. Search by keywords, method names, patterns. Duplication = bug. Found an analogue → use/extend it, do NOT rewrite from scratch.
- System logs ≠ user decisions.
- File >500 lines — split into modules.
- Do NOT generate reports unless Dmitry explicitly requests — save tokens.

# Prohibited
- Demo versions, simplified files, stubs instead of real implementations.
