"""
PreToolUse hook: NUDGE "delegate, don't do" via a 1-action budget (ADVISORY).

Purpose:
  The Lead (main Claude session) is supposed to orchestrate agents, not do
  the substantive work itself. pipeline.md says so, but soft rules get
  ignored. This hook keeps the same 1-action budget but, on exhaustion,
  emits a NON-BLOCKING advisory (additionalContext + exit 0) instead of a
  hard block. It nudges the Lead toward delegation without ever cancelling
  the tool call — and therefore without cancelling sibling calls in a
  parallel tool-batch (the harness cancels every sibling in a batch when
  any one returns non-zero; a hard block here used to take out the very
  Agent-spawn siblings that would have reset the budget).

  Hard teeth live elsewhere: go_gate / phase_gate / dep_guard /
  financial_dml_guard still block (exit 2). This gate is advisory only.

Contract:
  stdin  — PreToolUse JSON {tool_name, tool_input, cwd, agent_id, agent_type,
           session_id}
  stdout — on budget exhaustion ONLY: a single JSON line
           {"additionalContext": "<nudge>"}. No other path writes stdout.
  stderr — unused on the budget path (kept for malformed-payload note).
  exit   — 0 in ALL normal cases (allow + advisory). Exit 2 is reserved
           for the malformed-payload fail-closed branch ONLY.

Sub-agent auto-skip:
  Claude Code v2.1.114+ passes ``agent_id`` and ``agent_type`` fields in the
  hook stdin JSON for sub-agent sessions. If ``agent_id`` is a non-empty
  string the gate's purpose (force the Lead to delegate) is already
  satisfied — delegation has happened. We auto-skip (exit 0) and log the
  event for post-hoc surveillance.

State:
  <project_root>/.claude/.delegate_counter — integer count of action calls
  since the last delegation signal. Plain-text, single line.

"Actions" (counted, budget = 1):
  Bash (non-recon), Edit, Write, NotebookEdit

"Recon Bash" (NOT counted — free, like Reads):
  Read-only / diagnostic Bash: git status/diff/log, ls/find/grep,
  curl/wget, ssh, docker ps/logs, gh pr/issue, .claude/scripts/*,
  pip/npm list-family.  Matched by RECON_BASH_PATTERNS.

"Reads" (NOT counted — free, unlimited):
  Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch, ToolSearch, and any other tool
  not in the actions list.

"Delegation signals" (reset counter to 0, then allow):
  Agent       — main Claude spawned a sub-agent (Explore/Plan/general-purpose)
  TaskCreate  — TaskCreate is the orchestrator's planning primitive
  Bash invoking `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/supervisor/supervisor.py *`
    (or any path ending in /supervisor/supervisor.py) — /supervise worker spawn
  Bash invoking `codex_worker.sh <model>` or `codex exec -m <model>` —
    Codex CLI delegation (same budget-reset semantics as supervisor spawn).
  Bash invoking `mcp__pal__*` via shell is impossible — PAL is its own tool
    but since it runs a deep Claude-like analysis, it counts as delegation.
  Because the over-budget response is now advisory (exit 0), the Agent /
  TaskCreate sibling in a parallel batch always survives and resets the
  counter — the advisory is self-clearing.

Bypass (LEAD ONLY — sub-agents cannot self-disable):
  env CLAUDE_BOOSTER_SKIP_DELEGATE_GATE=1
  path allowlist match (reports/ audits/ *.md .claude/ etc.)
  (The legacy <project_root>/.claude/.delegate_mode file bypass has been
  RETIRED — the gate is advisory, so a bypass is no longer needed. Stale
  .delegate_mode files on disk are ignored.)

Phase-aware exemption:
  When <project_root>/.claude/.phase contains RECON or PLAN, the gate
  allows all tool calls without counting — these phases are inherently
  read-only (phase_gate.py blocks Edit/Write separately), so delegation
  enforcement is counterproductive.  If .phase is absent or contains any
  other value, the gate enforces normally.

Decision telemetry:
  Every invocation appends one JSON line to
  ~/.claude/logs/delegate_gate_decisions.jsonl with fields
  {ts, gate, decision, reason, agent_id, agent_type, tool_name, cwd,
  project, session_id, counter, budget}. Over-budget events log
  decision='advisory' (was 'block'). Fail-soft: log failures are swallowed
  — the gate's primary job is gating, not logging.

Limitations:
  - Per-project state in the repo, so parallel sessions on the same repo
    share the same counter (race-prone but state is idempotent).
  - Agent-spawn subprocesses run in their own tool context — the inner
    Claude's tool calls hit THEIR own hooks, not this one.
  - Advisory only: an over-budget action is NOT blocked, just nudged. The
    block-rate in gate_stats.py reads ~0 because over-budget now logs
    'advisory', not 'block' (gate_stats does not yet count 'advisory').
