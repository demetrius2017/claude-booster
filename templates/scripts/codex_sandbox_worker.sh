# codex_sandbox_worker.sh — run Codex CLI in an isolated git worktree, return diff
#
# Purpose:
#     Runs OpenAI Codex CLI in a git worktree (isolated checkout sharing .git
#     objects with the main repo). Codex gets full read/write power inside the
#     worktree. After Codex exits, captures `git diff HEAD` and outputs it on
#     stdout. The worktree is cleaned up automatically on exit.
#
#     Uses git worktree for ~10x faster isolation vs the old rsync-to-temp-dir
#     approach (~2-4s vs ~2min for large projects). Only tracked files are
#     checked out — node_modules, .venv, __pycache__ etc. are excluded by
#     design (they are gitignored).
#
# Contract:
#     stdin  — task description (piped to Codex via `-`)
#     stdout — unified diff of all changes Codex made (ONLY output on stdout)
#     stderr — status messages, Codex output, errors, verification reminder
#     exit   — 0 success (with or without diff), 1 Codex failure,
#              2 usage error, 127 binary not found
#
# Cleanup:
#     Worktree is removed via `git worktree remove --force` in an EXIT trap.
#     At startup, `git worktree prune` cleans stale worktrees from crashed runs.
#     This ensures worktrees never accumulate.
#
# CLI:
#     printf '%s\n' 'fix the bug in parser.py' | codex_sandbox_worker.sh gpt-5.3-codex
#     cat task.txt | codex_sandbox_worker.sh gpt-5.3-codex --json
#
# Limitations:
#     - Only tracked files appear in the worktree (gitignored dirs excluded).
#       .env/.env.local are copied explicitly if they exist.
#     - Requires the project to be a git repo (exits with error if not).
#     - Codex shell commands in the worktree can have side effects (network
#       calls, package installs) that are NOT reverted by worktree removal.
#
# ENV:
#     CODEX_BIN — override Codex binary path (default: /opt/homebrew/bin/codex)
#     TMPDIR    — base for worktree path (default: /tmp)
