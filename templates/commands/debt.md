Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and route to the matching mode below. No argument or `list` → run **LIST** mode. Otherwise match the first word.

---

## MODE: list (default)

Produce a debt inventory for the current session. Do all four scans, then merge and deduplicate before printing.

**Scan 1 — Task tool:**
Run `TaskList`. For every task whose status is NOT `completed`, record: task id, title, status (`in_progress` / `blocked` / `not_started`).

**Scan 2 — Session transcript patterns:**
Run:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/session_context.py --tools-only --grep "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|next session\|следующая сессия\|deferred\|Tier 2\|Tier 3" --no-thinking 2>/dev/null | tail -60
```
For each hit, extract the surrounding sentence and classify:
- `TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` in an Edit or Write call → likely open code debt.
- "next session" / "следующая сессия" / "deferred" in an assistant message → explicitly deferred work.
- "Tier 2" / "Tier 3" → backlog items that were consciously postponed.

Also run:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/session_context.py --tools-only --grep "test.*fail\|exit code [^0]\|FAILED\|ERROR" --no-thinking 2>/dev/null | tail -40
```
Any failing test that has no subsequent passing run = HIGH-priority debt.

**Scan 3 — Git state:**
```bash
git -C "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)" status --short 2>/dev/null
```
Uncommitted changes or untracked files in non-allowlisted paths (not `reports/`, `docs/`, `*.md`) → HIGH-priority debt.

**Scan 4 — Manual debts file:**
Read `.claude/.session_debts.json` (if it exists). Include every item with `status: "open"`. Items with `status: "BLOCKED-EXTERNAL"` go to the **separate blocked section** (see output format) — they are NOT open/closeable work.

**Merge and classify:**

| Priority | Condition |
|----------|-----------|
| HIGH | Failing tests not re-run; uncommitted non-doc changes; blocked tasks |
| MED | In-progress tasks without evidence of completion; deferred Tier 1 items; open `.session_debts.json` entries |
| LOW | Tier 2/3 items from transcript; nice-to-haves; documentation gaps |

**Output format:**
```
## Session Debt Inventory

[1] HIGH  Uncommitted changes in src/foo.py (git status)
[2] HIGH  Task "fix rebuilder edge case" is blocked (task-id: abc123)
[3] MED   "deferred to next session: dep_guard.py implementation" (transcript)
[4] LOW   Tier 3 — ADR adoption not yet started (transcript)

Total: 4 open items (2 HIGH, 1 MED, 1 LOW)

## Blocked — needs human  (NOT counted as open/closeable work)

[B1] apply prod index — needs: run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (prod-DB, user auth)
```

**[CRITICAL]** `BLOCKED-EXTERNAL` items are **excluded from the open count** and from any "close all debts" framing. They are not the agent's to close — only the user can clear them. Never re-classify a blocked item as open to "make progress," and never count them toward a `/goal`-style completion condition (see `goal-loop-discipline.md`). If there are blocked items but zero open items, the session is still **clean** for agent-actionable work — say so explicitly.

If both sections are empty: print `No open debts — session clean.` and stop.

---

## MODE: add

Parse: `add <description> [--priority HIGH|MED|LOW] [--origin <tag>] [--in-radius true|false]`. If no description, print usage and exit.

- `--priority` — defaults to `MED` if omitted.
- `--origin` — a scope tag (e.g. a `/go` run tag like `go:1718300000`). Defaults to `session`. Lets `/debt auto --scope <tag>` operate on just this run's debts.
- `--in-radius` — `true` if the debt is inside the artifact being built OR a direct caller/helper the current task touches; `false` if it's a tangential finding in adjacent code. Defaults to `true`. Only meaningful together with `--origin` (a scoped clear auto-fixes in-radius items and surfaces out-of-radius ones to the user).

Read `.claude/.session_debts.json` (return `[]` if file absent or unreadable).

Append a new entry:
```json
{"id": <next integer>, "description": "<description>", "priority": "<HIGH|MED|LOW>", "origin": "<tag|session>", "in_radius": <true|false>, "added_at": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>", "status": "open"}
```

Write back to `.claude/.session_debts.json`. Print:
```
Added debt #<id>: "<description>" [priority: <P>] [origin: <tag>] [<in-radius|adjacent>]
```

**[CRITICAL] Do NOT `/debt add` speculative or invented items to "show progress"** — especially under an active `/goal` (see `goal-loop-discipline.md` §3). Debt is for real, independently-actionable work. If a task's only precondition is a pending user authorization, it is NOT independently actionable — use `/debt block` (below), not `add`.

---

## MODE: block N

Parse `block <N> "<unblock_action>"`. Marks an existing debt as **blocked on an external/user action** the agent must not take unilaterally.

**Validity checklist — ALL must be true (else this is NOT a valid block; keep working):**
- The missing item is **external to the agent** (user authorization, a credential/secret only the user holds, an irreversible/external action per `core.md`, a human decision).
- The agent **cannot safely infer, substitute, or work around** it.
- **Meaningful safe progress is no longer possible** without it.
- `<unblock_action>` is **specific and minimal** — the exact smallest thing the user must do.

"This is hard / I'm stuck / tests fail" does **NOT** qualify — that is `core.md` Anti-Loop, not a block. Difficulty is never an external block.

Read `.claude/.session_debts.json`. Find item `id == N` (create the entry first via `add` if it's a transcript-only debt). Set:
```json
{"status": "BLOCKED-EXTERNAL", "unblock_action": "<unblock_action>", "blocked_at": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>"}
```
Write back. Print:
```
Debt [<N>] → BLOCKED-EXTERNAL. Needs human: <unblock_action>.
Excluded from open/closeable count. Clear it by doing the action, then /debt resolve <N>.
```

---

## MODE: work (no number)

1. Run LIST mode internally (do not reprint the full output — just build the inventory).
2. Select the first HIGH-priority item. If no HIGH items, select the first MED-priority item. If only LOW, select the first LOW item. If none, print `No open debts to work on.` and stop.
3. Print: `Working on debt [<N>] <priority>: <description>`
4. Create a task via `TaskCreate` with title = `debt[<N>]: <description>`.
5. Begin implementation. For code changes (Edit/Write to ≥2 files, or any behavior change), follow the paired Worker+Verifier pattern from `paired-verification.md`. For trivial changes (<2 files, formatting only, typo), proceed directly.

---

## MODE: work N

Parse `work <N>` where N is an integer.

Run LIST mode internally to get the current inventory. Find item `[N]`. If not found, print `Debt item [N] not found. Run /debt list to see current inventory.` and stop.

Print: `Working on debt [<N>] <priority>: <description>`

Create a task via `TaskCreate` with title = `debt[<N>]: <description>`.

Begin implementation per the same Worker+Verifier rules as MODE: work above.

---

## MODE: auto

Parse: `auto [--scope <tag>]`.

**Automatically resolve HIGH and MEDIUM debts; leave LOW debts for the user's decision; never touch `BLOCKED-EXTERNAL`.**

- **`--scope <tag>` (used by `/go`)** — operate ONLY on debts whose `origin == <tag>` (this one pipeline run's findings), not the whole board. Within scope, the in-radius/adjacent split applies:
  - **in-radius HIGH/MED** (`in_radius: true` — the artifact or a direct caller/helper the task touched) → **auto-fix** (this is the whole point of clearing within the Шестёрка).
  - **out-of-radius / adjacent HIGH/MED** (`in_radius: false` — tangential findings RECON noticed in surrounding code) → **do NOT auto-fix; surface them to the user as a review block** (they may be real, but fixing them would expand this task's blast radius beyond its scope).
  - **LOW (any)** → surface to the user.
- **No `--scope` (manual `/debt auto`)** — operate on the whole board: every HIGH/MED auto-worked regardless of radius, LOW to the user. (`in_radius` is ignored without a scope.)

**[CRITICAL] Recursion guard.** `/go` Phase 4 MAY invoke `/debt auto` after a PASS (opt-in via `CLAUDE_BOOSTER_POST_GO_AUTOFIX=1`; surface-only by default), and `/debt auto` resolves code debts BY invoking `/go` — without a guard this recurses explosively. So:
```bash
# At the very START of auto mode, write the guard marker:
touch "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.claude/.debt_auto_active"
```
Any `/go` spawned for a code debt below will see this marker and SKIP its own post-`/go` `/debt auto` step. **Remove the marker before returning, on EVERY exit path** (success, cap hit, error, hand-off to user):
```bash
rm -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.claude/.debt_auto_active"
```

1. Write the recursion-guard marker (above). Then run LIST mode internally to build the inventory. **If `--scope <tag>` was given, filter the inventory to debts whose `origin == <tag>` from here on** (everything else stays untouched).
2. Determine the **auto-work set**: HIGH/MED items that are eligible for auto-fix.
   - With `--scope`: only items with `in_radius: true`. Items with `in_radius: false` (adjacent) are NOT auto-worked — they go to the user review block in step 4.
   - Without `--scope`: all HIGH/MED items.
   **If the auto-work set is empty** → skip straight to step 4 (nothing to auto-work).
3. **Auto-work loop** — repeat until the auto-work set is empty (hard cap: **12 iterations** to prevent runaway; if the cap is hit, stop and report what's left):
   a. Select the first HIGH item in the auto-work set; if none, the first MED item in it.
   b. Print: `Auto-working debt [<N>] <priority>: <description>`
   c. Resolve it by its nature:
      - **Substantial code** (≥20 lines / any behaviour change / ≥2 files) → run it through **`/go`** (the Шестёрка) so it is designed, cross-provider verified, and KPI-recorded. Do NOT hand-write it inline.
      - **Trivial** (config/doc/<20 lines, formatting, typo) → Lead edits directly.
      - **Uncommitted-change debt** → commit it (with a real message). **Failing-test debt** → fix + re-run until green.
   d. On success → `/debt resolve <N>` and commit. Re-run LIST (a fix may surface a NEW HIGH/MED follow-up, or close several at once).
   e. **If a debt turns out to need the user** (a real external/auth/irreversible blocker surfaces per `core.md`) → `/debt block <N> "<unblock_action>"` and move on. **If a debt fails to resolve twice** → skip it, leave it open, report it, and move on (`core.md` Anti-Loop — never a third identical attempt).
4. **Hand the rest to the user — STOP, do NOT auto-work it:** remove the recursion-guard marker first, then print:
   ```
   /debt auto<scope?> — done.
   Auto-resolved <K> in-radius HIGH/MED debts:
     [N] <priority> <description> → <how: /go PASS / committed / fixed> (<commit SHA>)
     ...
   <if any were skipped/blocked: list them with the reason>

   Adjacent findings (out-of-radius — RECON noticed these in surrounding code; fixing
   them would widen this task's scope, so they're YOUR call):
     [N] <HIGH|MED>  <description>  (<file:line>)
     ...
   Remaining LOW debts — YOUR call:
     [N] LOW  <description>
     ...
   Reply with numbers to work (e.g. "work 4 6"), or "skip" to leave them.
   ```
   The "Adjacent findings" block appears only in scoped mode (it lists the out-of-radius HIGH/MED). `BLOCKED-EXTERNAL` items, if any, are listed separately as needs-human. If nothing remains for the user → print `Board clear — all in-radius HIGH/MED auto-resolved, nothing left for you.`

**[CRITICAL] Guardrails (auto mode is powerful — these are non-negotiable):**
- NEVER auto-work a `LOW` item or a `BLOCKED-EXTERNAL` item — both require the user. LOW is explicitly the user's decision boundary.
- NEVER invent debts to keep the loop running (`goal-loop-discipline.md` §3). The loop ends when the real HIGH/MED inventory is empty, not when you run out of obvious work.
- Each auto-worked code debt MUST pass its own verification (the Шестёрка's exit-code test gate, or a real command for non-`/go` debts). "Looks done" is not resolved.
- Re-run LIST every iteration — operate on the live inventory, not a stale snapshot.

---

## MODE: resolve N

Parse `resolve <N>` where N is an integer.

**Check TaskList:** if there is a task matching `debt[N]:`, update it to `completed` via `TaskUpdate`.

**Check `.session_debts.json`:** read the file. If an item with matching `id` exists, set its `status` to `"resolved"` and add `"resolved_at": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>"`. Write back.

Print: `Resolved debt [<N>]. Item marked closed.`

If item N was not found in either source, print: `Debt item [N] not found. It may have been from a transcript scan (not stored). Run /debt list to verify current state.`

---

## MODE: review

Generate a formatted debt summary suitable for pasting into a handover report.

1. Run LIST mode internally to build the full inventory.
2. Format output as:

```markdown
## Outstanding Debts

| # | Priority | Description | Status |
|---|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | HIGH | Tests not passing for require_task.py edge case | open |
| 2 | MED | dep_guard.py not yet implemented (Tier 2) | deferred |
| 3 | LOW | ADR practice not yet adopted in any project | backlog |

### Blocked — needs human (not agent-actionable)

| # | Needs from you |
|---|----------------|
| B1 | apply prod index — run `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (prod-DB, user auth) |

Carried from: <session JSONL path or "current session">
```

Keep the two sections separate. `BLOCKED-EXTERNAL` items go ONLY in the "Blocked — needs human" table, never in "Outstanding Debts" — the next session must see them as human-gated, not as unfinished agent work. Omit the blocked table entirely if there are no blocked items.

3. If the inventory is empty, output:
```markdown
## Outstanding Debts

No outstanding debts — session clean.
```

4. Print the block to stdout. Do NOT write it to a file — the caller (handover or user) will copy-paste it.

---

## Integration note for /handover

When running `/handover`, invoke `/debt review` before finalising the report and insert its output as the `## Outstanding Debts` section. Place it after `## Problems / Solutions` and before `## Required reading`. If the section is already present in a prior handover template, replace it with the fresh output.
