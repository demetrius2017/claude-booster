---

## Progress tracking
Before each numbered step below, run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress "<N>/6 <step_label>"`
After the final step completes, run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress clear`

Steps: `1/6 flow_designer`, `2/6 challenge`, `3/6 worker_verifier`, `4/6 test_run`, `5/6 diff_review`, `6/6 verdict`

---

## Phase 0 — AC VALIDATION (Lead, mandatory before any agent spawns)

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as the Artifact Contract. It may also be formulated in the preceding conversation context if the user said "run /go" after building the AC together.

Check that the Artifact Contract contains ALL of these mandatory fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Objective:` | One sentence — what the system should do after this change |
| `Verified Facts Brief:` | Current state evidence with file:line references (NOT docs or memory alone) |
| `Artifact path:` | Where Worker writes the result |
| `Expected observable behavior:` | What an external observer sees (curl response, file content, stdout, etc.) |
| `Acceptance emphasis:` | What Verifier must specifically check |

**If ANY field is missing:**

Output exactly:
```
/go BLOCKED — Artifact Contract incomplete.

Missing fields:
  - <field name>: <what is needed>
  ...

Complete the AC and re-run /go. Do not proceed without a complete AC.
```

Then STOP. Do NOT spawn any agents.

**If AC is complete:** write the .go_active marker so the go_gate hook allows Agent spawns during this pipeline run. Write a **run tag** into the marker — it scopes this run's RECON findings (Phase 1) and the post-pipeline debt clear (Phase 4):
```bash
RUNTAG="go:$(date +%s)"
printf '%s\n' "$RUNTAG" > "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.claude/.go_active"
```
Remember `RUNTAG` for the rest of the pipeline (go_gate checks marker *existence*, not content — the tag is for debt scoping). Then proceed to Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1 — FLOW DESIGNER

Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress "1/6 flow_designer"`

Query the model balancer:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/model_balancer.py get hard
```

Use the returned provider/model for the Flow Designer. Fallback if balancer fails: provider `anthropic`, `model: "opus"`.

### Spawn mechanics by provider

| Provider from `get hard` | Flow Designer spawn path |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` or balancer error | Spawn ONE Flow Designer via the **Agent tool** with the returned model; fallback `model: "opus"`. **NOT `run_in_background`** — Lead waits for the result before Phase 1B. |
| `codex-cli` | Run the Flow Designer via Bash: `~/.claude/scripts/codex_worker.sh <model> < <prompt-file>`, piping the Flow Designer prompt on stdin and capturing stdout as the YAML PFD. This is the read-only TEXT channel: the Flow Designer emits a PFD, not code. Lead waits; this is a foreground Bash call. |

**Flow Designer agent prompt:**

```
You are a Flow Designer agent. Your role is to produce a Process Flow Document (PFD) for the following task.

The PFD is the foundational artifact that shapes what both the Worker and the Verifier will do.
It is NOT a design doc — it is a map of temporal traps, branching outcomes, and invariants.
Be specific. Be pessimistic. Name every failure mode.

---

## Artifact Contract

<INSERT FULL ARTIFACT CONTRACT FROM PHASE 0>

---

## Your methodology: Three Lenses

Apply ALL three lenses to the task described in the Artifact Contract:

**Lens 1 — Temporal Projection:** For every non-trivial state variable, ask "what will this value be at effect-time, not read-time?" Identify STATIC / DECAYING / ACCUMULATING / VOLATILE / PERIODIC variables. Quantify temporal gaps (how long between phases? what drifts during that time?).

**Lens 2 — Branching & Failure Modes:** Apply HAZOP guide words (NO, MORE, LESS, REVERSE, LATE, EARLY, OTHER, PARTIAL) to every external interaction (DB, API, filesystem, broker, network). For each operation, enumerate at minimum: success, one failure, one partial/race outcome. Identify blast radius per branch.

**Lens 3 — State Dependency Cascade:** When source state X changes, what derived values become stale? Trace cascade chains. Identify consistency boundaries (atomic vs eventually consistent). Name hidden consumers of derived state.

---

## Required output: PFD in YAML format

Produce a PFD with ALL of the following sections (per flow-designer.md §4 schema):

- `meta` — task, temporal_class, time_horizon, critical_state_vars
- `timeline` — ordered phases, each with state_at_entry + operations + per-outcome state_delta + next_phase + recovery
- `state_variables` — name, temporal_class, freshness_window, depends_on, cascade_depth, recompute_trigger
- `branching_scenarios` — per operation: all branches, guide_word, state_after, downstream_effects, blast_radius, recovery
- `failure_modes` — id, guide_word, operation, trigger, affected_state, detection, downstream_impact, mitigation, category
- `invariants` — name, expression (formal/semi-formal boolean), violation_consequence, enforcement_point
- `temporal_gaps` — between (phases), duration (MUST be quantified), drifting_state, drift_rate, stale_after, mitigation
- `cascade_chains` — trigger, chain, propagation_time, atomicity, current_gap
- `worker_directives` — imperative ("MUST..."), rationale (which failure_mode/gap this prevents), enforcement type
- `verifier_assertions` — assertion (what to test), type (temporal/branching/invariant/freshness/cascade), how (concrete test approach), derived_from (failure_mode ID or invariant)
- `branch_tree.mermaid` — visual graph of operations and outcomes (all non-success terminals shown)
- `adjacent_findings` — **RECON-as-review output.** While reading the existing code to build the PFD, do NOT just study it — REVIEW it critically, the way a code reviewer would. Every defect, inaccuracy, wrong assumption, missing guard, dead code, or risky pattern you notice in the code you read becomes an entry here. This is separate from `failure_modes` (those are about the NEW artifact); `adjacent_findings` is about the EXISTING surrounding code. Each entry: `location` (file:line), `severity` (HIGH = real bug / MED = inaccuracy or latent risk / LOW = smell or style), `in_radius` (true if it sits in the artifact being built OR a direct caller/helper this task touches; false if it is tangential code you happened to read), `issue` (one line), `fix` (one line). Empty list is allowed ONLY if the code you read was genuinely clean — say so explicitly rather than omitting the section.

Quality criteria — your PFD FAILS internal review if:
- Any operation has only one outcome (happy path only)
- Any temporal_gap has vague duration ("some time", "eventually") — MUST be quantified
- Any invariant is not expressible as a boolean assertion
- Any worker_directive is advisory ("should", "consider") instead of imperative ("MUST")
- The branch_tree shows no non-success terminal states
- The failure_modes list is empty

Output ONLY the YAML PFD. No prose before or after.
```

**After Flow Designer returns:**

Extract from the PFD:
- Count of `failure_modes` entries → `<N>`
- Count of `worker_directives` entries → `<M>`
- Count of `verifier_assertions` entries → `<K>`

Output:
```
Flow Designer complete. PFD: <N> failure modes, <M> worker directives, <K> verifier assertions.
```

**RECON-as-review harvest — log each `adjacent_findings` entry as a scoped debt:**
For every entry in the PFD's `adjacent_findings`, run:
```bash
/debt add "<issue> — fix: <fix> (<location>)" --priority <HIGH|MED|LOW> --origin "$RUNTAG" --in-radius <true|false>
```
These are findings about EXISTING code, scoped to this run via `$RUNTAG`. They are NOT worked now — they are cleared at the very end (Phase 4 post-pipeline) by `/debt auto --scope "$RUNTAG"`, which auto-fixes only the in-radius HIGH/MED and surfaces the rest to the user. Output: `RECON review: +<X> adjacent findings logged (<a> in-radius, <b> adjacent).`

Save the full PFD text for Phase 1B.

---

## Phase 1B — PFD ADVERSARIAL CHALLENGE (cross-provider, Opus)

Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress "2/6 challenge"`

The Flow Designer drafted the PFD on the `hard` tier. This phase has a **different-provider** reviewer attack that PFD **before any code is written** — the cheapest place to catch rework. (Consilium 2026-06-13: contract ambiguity + missed failure modes are ~65% of returns-to-code; model capability is ~5%. Design-time is where the strong model earns its keep — see `reports/consilium_2026-06-13_dual_model_rework_reduction.md`, SHIP-1.)

**Provider rule — the challenge MUST run on a different provider than the Flow Designer (this is the whole point — a model cannot find its own blind spots):**

- Check what `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/model_balancer.py get hard` returned for Phase 1.
- **If Flow Designer's provider was NOT `anthropic`** (e.g. `codex-cli:gpt-5.5` — today's pinned state): spawn ONE Challenge **Agent** with `model: "opus"` explicitly. **NOT `run_in_background`** — Lead waits.
- **If Flow Designer's provider WAS `anthropic`** (balancer routed `hard` to Claude): run the challenge via Bash instead, to stay cross-provider — `~/.claude/scripts/codex_worker.sh gpt-5.5 < <prompt-file>` — capture stdout as the critique. (Codex is read-only analysis here; it produces a critique, never code.)

Either way the prompt is identical:

**Challenge prompt:**

```
You are a PFD Challenge agent. A Flow Designer (a DIFFERENT model) produced the Process Flow Document below. Attack it adversarially and find what it missed — before any code is written. You do NOT write code. You do NOT rewrite the PFD. You return a structured critique with concrete additions.

---

## Artifact Contract
<INSERT FULL ARTIFACT CONTRACT FROM PHASE 0>

---

## Process Flow Document to challenge
<INSERT FULL PFD FROM PHASE 1>

---

## Attack it on five axes — be specific (name the field / operation, not "improve error handling"):

1. MISSING FAILURE MODES — apply each HAZOP guide word (NO/MORE/LESS/REVERSE/LATE/EARLY/OTHER/PARTIAL) to every external interaction in the PFD. Which guide word produced NO failure_mode entry? Add it.
2. CONTRACT AMBIGUITY — is any AC field underspecified so that "correct" is undefined (a silent input, an unspecified error shape, an undefined return on an edge)? If yes → A-class signal; name the exact ambiguity.
3. INTEGRATION MISMATCH — does the task touch existing code? Which existing helper/function/invariant could this duplicate or break? (This is the #1 under-caught rework class — design review usually misses it.)
4. WEAK INVARIANTS — is any invariant not expressible as a boolean assertion? Any temporal_gap duration vague? Any worker_directive advisory ("should") instead of imperative ("MUST")?
5. VERIFIER BLIND SPOTS — is there a failure_mode with NO corresponding verifier_assertion? Every CRITICAL/HIGH failure mode must be testable.

## Required output — structured, no prose preamble:

VERDICT: SOUND | GAPS_FOUND | CONTRACT_AMBIGUOUS

ADDITIONS (only if GAPS_FOUND):
- new_failure_modes: [<id, guide_word, trigger, mitigation, category> ...]
- new_worker_directives: [<imperative "MUST..." + rationale> ...]
- new_verifier_assertions: [<assertion + how-to-test + derived_from> ...]
- invariant_fixes: [<which invariant, how to make it boolean> ...]

CONTRACT_AMBIGUITY (only if CONTRACT_AMBIGUOUS):
- <exact field + what is undefined + what the AC must specify>

Output only the verdict block. Be ruthless but concrete — a vague critique is worse than none.
```

**After Challenge returns — Lead reconciles (additive, deterministic):**

- **VERDICT: SOUND** → PFD unchanged. Output `Challenge: SOUND — PFD held.` Proceed to Phase 2 with the original PFD.
- **VERDICT: GAPS_FOUND** → APPEND the agent's `new_failure_modes`, `new_worker_directives`, `new_verifier_assertions`, and `invariant_fixes` into the PFD's corresponding sections. **Additive only** — the challenge may ADD requirements, never delete the Flow Designer's. Output `Challenge: GAPS_FOUND — +<a> failure modes, +<b> directives, +<c> assertions folded into PFD.` Proceed to Phase 2 with the **augmented PFD**.
- **VERDICT: CONTRACT_AMBIGUOUS** → A-class signal caught at design time (far cheaper than a post-implementation A/W-failure). STOP and surface to the user:
  ```
  /go PAUSED — PFD challenge found the Artifact Contract ambiguous:
    <the ambiguity from the challenge>
  Clarify the AC, then re-run /go. (Catching this now is exactly why the challenge exists.)
  ```
  Then run `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress clear` and remove the .go_active marker:
  ```bash
  rm -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.claude/.go_active"
  ```

**Why additive reconciliation preserves the exit-code axiom:** the challenge never produces code and never overrides a test verdict — it only enriches the PFD with more failure modes and stricter assertions. More verifier_assertions = a stricter acceptance test, which can only make a defective Worker output more likely to FAIL, never more likely to wrongly PASS. The "PASS = test exit code only" axiom is untouched.

---

## Phase 2 — WORKER + VERIFIER (parallel, cross-provider)

Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress "3/6 worker_verifier"`

### Escalation decision (SHIP-4) — single Worker vs /hackathon tournament

Before spawning the Worker, decide whether this task warrants COMPETING implementations. Default is a single Worker (the standard path below). Escalate to a `/hackathon` tournament ONLY when **BOTH** conditions hold:

- **A. High stakes** — the task is in a high-blast-radius class: auth / secrets, DB schema migration, financial DML, concurrency / caching, multi-service contract, or infra config. A subtle wrong choice here is expensive, so a second independent attempt pays for itself.
- **B. Genuine solution uncertainty** — the PFD or the Phase 1B challenge surfaced ≥2 materially different viable approaches, OR ≥1 CRITICAL failure mode whose mitigation is non-obvious. If there is one obvious correct implementation, a tournament just burns 2–3× cost for identical results.

**If NOT both → single Worker** (continue to the standard path below). Most tasks land here — escalation is the exception, gated to protect cost (consilium 2026-06-13, SHIP-4: do NOT escalate by default).

**If both → escalate to `/hackathon`** for the implementation stage:
- Pass the PFD-augmented Artifact Contract as the hackathon Artifact Contract.
- Seed the Judge Mandate from the PFD `verifier_assertions` + `invariants` — the deterministic acceptance the Шестёрка already derived.
- Spawn the 2–3 candidates ACROSS providers (e.g. one Opus Agent + one Codex `codex_sandbox_worker.sh gpt-5.5`) so the tournament tests provider diversity, not just prompt diversity.
- The hackathon's deterministic Judge (exit-code score, winner-take-all) REPLACES the single cross-provider Verifier for this run — same no-LLM-judgment axiom, stronger evidence. It includes the SHIP-4 **edge-test harvest** (losers' test coverage unioned into the winner's suite; see `hackathon.md` Phase 4).
- When the hackathon returns a winner, **resume the Шестёрка at Phase 3B** (diff-review the winner) → Phase 4 verdict. Skip the standard single-Worker path below.
- Log it in the verdict: `implementation: /hackathon (N candidates, winner cN, score X/Y)`.

---

### Standard path — single Worker + cross-provider Verifier

Query the model balancer for the coding tier:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/model_balancer.py get coding
```
It returns `{"provider": "<WP>", "model": "<WM>"}`. Call these the **Worker provider `WP`** and **Worker model `WM`**. Fallback if the balancer fails: `WP=anthropic, WM=sonnet`.

### [CRITICAL] SHIP-2 — the Verifier runs on a DIFFERENT provider than the Worker

A model verifying its own output shares its own blind spots — same-provider verification is the correlated-failure mode that the Fable→mono-provider regression introduced (consilium 2026-06-13, SHIP-2). The **Verifier provider `VP` is forced to the OTHER provider:**

| Worker provider `WP` | Verifier provider `VP` | Verifier model |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `codex-cli` (today's pinned state) | `anthropic` | `opus` |
| `anthropic` | `codex-cli` | `gpt-5.5` |

This guarantees Worker and Verifier never share a provider. The Verifier still sees ONLY the AC fields + PFD `verifier_assertions`/`invariants`/`branching_scenarios` (never the Worker's prompt or code) — cross-provider does not relax the knowledge boundary, it hardens it.

(The table reads from the Claude-CLI viewpoint. The real invariant is "Worker and Verifier on DIFFERENT providers", which is provider-symmetric: on Codex CLI the native model is gpt-5.5 and "the other provider" is Claude. When this command runs under Codex via the bridge, the `booster-command` skill's "Cross-provider stages" adapter handles the mirror + the degrade-and-log fallback. The same applies to the Phase 1B Challenge and Phase 3B Diff-review.)

### Spawn mechanics by provider

The Agent tool spawns Claude models only; Codex spawns via the sandbox worker, which runs in an isolated git worktree and emits a unified diff on stdout (Lead applies each changed file via Edit/Write, so `dep_guard.py` / `financial_dml_guard.py` / `verify_gate.py` fire on every write).

| Provider | Spawn channel | Background? |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `anthropic` | Agent tool, `model: <tier>`, `run_in_background: true` | yes |
| `codex-cli` | Bash `~/.claude/scripts/codex_sandbox_worker.sh <model> < <prompt-file>` → diff on stdout; Lead applies via Edit/Write | no (foreground) |

**Preserve parallelism — spawn the anthropic side as a background Agent FIRST, then run the codex side foreground** (the Agent runs concurrently in the background while Codex executes in its worktree). Because `VP` is forced to differ from `WP`, exactly one side is anthropic and one is codex-cli — never two foreground Bash calls, never two Agents.

- **Today (`WP=codex-cli`):** (1) spawn the **Verifier** as a background Opus Agent (`model: "opus"`, `run_in_background: true`); (2) run the **Worker** via `codex_sandbox_worker.sh "$WM" < worker_prompt.txt`, capture the diff, apply each changed file via Edit/Write; (3) collect the Verifier's test path when it returns.
- **If `WP=anthropic`:** (1) spawn the **Worker** as a background Agent (`model: "$WM"`, `run_in_background: true`); (2) run the **Verifier** via `codex_sandbox_worker.sh gpt-5.5 < verifier_prompt.txt`, apply the emitted test file via Write; (3) collect the Worker's artifact when it returns.

The Worker and Verifier **prompts are identical regardless of provider** — only the spawn channel differs. Use the prompt blocks below verbatim.

**Degradation (cross-provider is a quality optimization, NOT a safety gate):** if the required other-provider channel is unavailable (e.g. the `codex` binary is missing, or Codex auth fails), fall back to a same-provider Verifier on the Agent tool and **log the degradation** in the Phase 4 verdict line (`cross-provider: DEGRADED — Verifier on same provider as Worker (<reason>)`). Do NOT wedge the pipeline over it — a same-provider test is weaker than cross-provider but still far better than no test.

---

### Worker agent prompt:

```
You are a Worker agent. Implement the following task.

This is a delegated implementation task. Do the work — write the code, make the changes,
produce the artifact at the specified path. Do not explain plans. Do not ask for confirmation.

---

## Artifact Contract

<INSERT FULL ARTIFACT CONTRACT FROM PHASE 0>

---

## Process Flow Document (PFD)

<INSERT FULL PFD — the Phase 1B-augmented version if the challenge returned GAPS_FOUND, else the Phase 1 original>

---

## [CRITICAL] Worker directives from PFD

These are imperative requirements, not suggestions. Implement EVERY directive:

<INSERT worker_directives SECTION FROM PFD>

These directives exist because the Flow Designer identified specific failure modes that
flat/happy-path implementation would miss. Skipping any directive = leaving a known defect.

---

## Deliverable

Implement the task. Write the result to the artifact path specified in the Artifact Contract.
If the artifact path is a code file, write the complete implementation.
If it is a directory, produce all required files within it.

Do not write a test — that is the Verifier's job.
```

---

### Verifier agent prompt:

```
You are a Verifier agent. Write an executable acceptance test for the following task.

You are independent. You have NOT seen the Worker's implementation.
You do NOT know how the Worker chose to implement anything.
Your job is to test observable behavior — what an external observer sees —
against the contract and the failure modes identified by the Flow Designer.

---

## Artifact Contract (what you are testing against)

Objective: <INSERT Objective FROM AC>
Artifact path: <INSERT Artifact path FROM AC>
Expected observable behavior: <INSERT Expected observable behavior FROM AC>
Acceptance emphasis: <INSERT Acceptance emphasis FROM AC>

---

## From the PFD: what to test

### Verifier assertions
<INSERT verifier_assertions SECTION FROM PFD ONLY>

### Invariants (must hold after execution)
<INSERT invariants SECTION FROM PFD ONLY>

### Branching scenarios (cover at least one non-happy-path branch)
<INSERT branching_scenarios SECTION FROM PFD ONLY>

---

## Test script requirements

Write a bash or python test script that:

1. Tests each verifier_assertion from the PFD — one assertion = one labeled test case
2. Checks each invariant holds after execution — assert the boolean expression or its observable proxy
3. Covers at least one non-happy-path branch from branching_scenarios — inject the failure condition and assert correct handling
4. Outputs clear PASS/FAIL per test case:
   ```
   [PASS] assertion: <description>
   [FAIL] assertion: <description> — expected <X>, got <Y>
   ```
5. Prints a summary at the end:
   ```
   Results: <N> passed, <M> failed
   ```
6. Exits with code 0 if ALL assertions pass, non-zero if ANY fail

Save the test script to: `<artifact_path_dir>/test_<artifact_name>.sh`
(or `.py` if Python is more natural for the assertion logic)

Where `<artifact_path_dir>` = directory containing the artifact path from the AC,
and `<artifact_name>` = basename of the artifact without extension.

Do not modify the Worker's artifact. Do not implement any feature logic.
Test only. Read, run, assert, report.
```

---

### Progress output — the Шестёрка bar (6 stages, 6 segments)

The pipeline has SIX stages, so the status bar has six segments. Emit the matching line as each stage completes (fill one segment per phase):
```
Шестёрка ▰▱▱▱▱▱ 1/6 · Flow Designer ✓
Шестёрка ▰▰▱▱▱▱ 2/6 · Challenge ✓
Шестёрка ▰▰▰▱▱▱ 3/6 · Worker ✓ · Verifier ✓
Шестёрка ▰▰▰▰▱▱ 4/6 · Test ✓
Шестёрка ▰▰▰▰▰▱ 5/6 · Diff review ✓
Шестёрка ▰▰▰▰▰▰ 6/6 · Verdict ✓
```
If a stage is skipped or degraded, annotate that segment instead of dropping it — e.g. `5/6 · Diff review SKIPPED (trivial diff)` or `3/6 · cross-provider DEGRADED`. The bar always shows all six segments so the reader sees the whole pipeline.

Do NOT begin Phase 3 until BOTH Worker and Verifier have returned.

---

## Phase 3 — TEST RUN

Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress "4/6 test_run"`

After both agents complete:

1. Read the Verifier's test script from the path it wrote (the `test_<artifact_name>.sh` or `.py` file).
2. Run it:
   ```bash
   bash <test_script_path>
   ```
   (Use `python3 <test_script_path>` if the file is `.py`)
3. Capture the full stdout + stderr output and the exit code.
4. Output:
   ```
   Test result: exit=<N>
   <stdout/stderr output>
   ```

**Do NOT skip this phase.** "The code looks correct" is not a substitute for an executable test.

---

## Phase 3B — POST-IMPLEMENTATION DIFF REVIEW (cross-provider, only on PASS)

**Run only if Phase 3 returned exit=0.** If the test failed, skip straight to Phase 4 fail-classification — there is nothing to review yet.

Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress "5/6 diff_review"`

The Verifier tested *observable behavior* but never saw the code. This phase gives the **diff itself** a second look by a different-provider reviewer — to catch defects that emerge at implementation time and that a behavioral test does not exercise: integration breakage, reinvented helpers, security holes, dead/over-broad churn. Per consilium 2026-06-13 (SHIP-3): design-time review cannot see these — they live in the written code.

**Skip criteria (log the skip in the verdict):** the diff is trivial — docs/comments only, or < ~15 changed lines with no logic / control-flow / IO. Otherwise the review runs.

**Provider rule:** the reviewer MUST run on a different provider than the Worker (it reads the Worker's code, so it must not be the author's own model). Same mapping as the Verifier:
- `WP=codex-cli` → reviewer = Opus **Agent** (`model: "opus"`), read-only.
- `WP=anthropic` → reviewer = `~/.claude/scripts/codex_worker.sh gpt-5.5 < review_prompt.txt` (read-only text analysis — produces findings, never code).

Collect the diff first: `git -C "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" diff -- <changed paths>` (or read the files the Worker wrote).

**Reviewer prompt:**

```
You are a Post-Implementation Diff Reviewer. The code below already PASSED its acceptance test. Give the DIFF a different-provider second look for defects a behavioral test cannot catch. You do NOT write or rewrite code — you return structured findings only.

## Artifact Contract
<INSERT FULL ARTIFACT CONTRACT FROM PHASE 0>

## Diff under review
<INSERT git diff OF THE WORKER'S CHANGES>

## Review on four axes — be concrete, cite file:line:
1. INTEGRATION — does this break a caller, change a depended-on signature/contract, or REINVENT an existing helper/function? (The #1 emergent defect; design review can't see it.)
2. MINIMALITY — unnecessary churn, dead code, a broad refactor where a small patch would do, unrelated formatting. Smaller diff = lower regression risk.
3. SECURITY — injection, secrets in code, unsafe path/SQL/shell construction, missing validation at a boundary, auth/permission gaps.
4. UNTESTED BEHAVIOR — a code path the acceptance test clearly does not exercise that could fail in production (error branch, edge input, resource cleanup, partial failure).

## Output — structured, no preamble:
VERDICT: CLEAN | FINDINGS
FINDINGS (each):
- severity: HIGH | MED | LOW
- axis: integration | minimality | security | untested
- location: <file:line>
- issue: <what is wrong, concretely>
- fix_directive: <imperative "MUST ..." the Worker can act on>

Only HIGH findings block. A vague finding is noise — omit it.
```

**Lead reconciliation:**
- **VERDICT CLEAN, or only MED/LOW findings** → review passes. Log MED/LOW in the Phase 4 verdict line (advisory — surface them, do not silently drop, do not auto-fix). Proceed to Phase 4 PASS.
- **Any HIGH finding** → **R-failure**: respawn the Worker on the same provider `WP` with the HIGH `fix_directive`s appended to its prompt, plus the failed-attempt session context (`session_context.py --agent "<Worker desc>" --no-thinking`). Then **re-run Phase 3 (the SAME Verifier test — it MUST stay green)** and **re-run this Phase 3B review**. R counts toward the 3-retry cap (shared with V/W). The reviewer never edits code — only the Worker does, and the unchanged test still gates.

**Why this preserves the axiom:** the reviewer produces findings, never code, and never overrides the test verdict. A HIGH finding routes to a Worker fix that must still pass the unchanged Verifier test — so PASS stays "exit code of the test", never "the reviewer approved it".

---

## Phase 4 — VERDICT

Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress "6/6 verdict"`

### If exit=0 (ALL PASS) AND Phase 3B review cleared (CLEAN, or only MED/LOW):

```
✓ PASS — Шестёрка ▰▰▰▰▰▰ 6/6 complete. Artifact at <artifact_path>.
```
Append any of these that apply (honest status, not silent drop):
- `diff review: <CLEAN | N MED/LOW advisory findings — list them as follow-ups | SKIPPED (trivial diff)>`
- `cross-provider: <OK | DEGRADED (<reason>)>` (if the Verifier or reviewer fell back to same-provider in Phase 2/3B)

**Record the KPI outcome (SHIP instrumentation — proves the pipeline reduces rework):**
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/kpi_rework.py record \
  --task "<short Objective>" --outcome pass \
  --worker-spawns <1 + number of W/R Worker re-spawns> \
  --verifier-fails <number of test-fail cycles that occurred: V + W + R retries> \
  [--category <defect>:<count> for each classified retry]
```
First-pass-clean run → `--worker-spawns 1 --verifier-fails 0` (no `--category`). For each retry that happened, tag the defect category (W/V/A/R → category): A-failure → `contract_ambiguity`; V-failure → `weak_verification`; W-failure → `missed_failure_mode` (or `integration_mismatch` / `capability` if that fits better); R-failure (Phase 3B HIGH) → `integration_mismatch` (or the finding's axis). A CONTRACT_AMBIGUOUS caught at Phase 1B and resolved pre-code is NOT a retry — it is prevented rework, so it does not count toward `verifier-fails`.

Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress clear`

Capture the run tag, then remove the .go_active marker (the pipeline is now complete):
```bash
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
RUNTAG="$(cat "$ROOT/.claude/.go_active" 2>/dev/null)"   # the tag written at Phase 0
rm -f "$ROOT/.claude/.go_active"
```

### Post-pipeline — surface THIS run's findings (auto-fix is OPT-IN)

RECON-as-review already harvested this run's `adjacent_findings` into scoped debts (origin `$RUNTAG`) back in Phase 1 — that collection always happens and nothing is lost. What this step decides is whether to **auto-fix** them now.

**Default — SURFACE only, do NOT auto-fix.** Auto-fixing was made opt-in deliberately: an always-on auto-fix balloons a small `/go` and the disable-flag would be forgotten. So by default, just point at the findings:
```bash
# count this run's scoped open debts (origin == RUNTAG); print a one-line pointer:
echo "Шестёрка: logged <N> findings for this run [origin $RUNTAG] (<M> in-radius HIGH/MED). To auto-fix the in-radius ones now: /debt auto --scope \"$RUNTAG\"   ·   to review all: /debt list"
```
The findings stay in `.session_debts.json` (visible via `/debt list`), scoped to `$RUNTAG`. The user fixes them whenever they want — `/debt auto --scope "$RUNTAG"` (auto-fix in-radius HIGH/MED, surface adjacent+LOW) or `/debt work <N>` individually.

**Opt-in — auto-fix in-radius now.** Run the scoped clear automatically ONLY if BOTH:
- env `CLAUDE_BOOSTER_POST_GO_AUTOFIX=1` is set (the user opted into post-`/go` auto-fixing), AND
- the marker `<project>/.claude/.debt_auto_active` does NOT exist (recursion guard — this `/go` was NOT spawned by `/debt auto`; otherwise auto-fixing again would recurse).

```bash
# auto-fix gate:
if [ "${CLAUDE_BOOSTER_POST_GO_AUTOFIX:-0}" = "1" ] && [ ! -f "$ROOT/.claude/.debt_auto_active" ]; then
  echo "RUN /debt auto --scope $RUNTAG (opt-in autofix)"
else
  echo "SURFACE only (default — autofix opt-in via CLAUDE_BOOSTER_POST_GO_AUTOFIX=1)"
fi
```
If the gate says RUN → invoke `/debt auto --scope "$RUNTAG"`. Otherwise print the one-line pointer above and finish.

Done.

### If exit≠0 (FAIL):

Classify the failure using this decision tree. Read the test output carefully before classifying.

| Question | If YES → |
|----------|----------|
| Does the test assert something NOT stated in the AC or PFD (Verifier overstepped)? | **V-failure** |
| Does the test assert something IN the AC/PFD, but Worker didn't implement it? | **W-failure** |
| Is the AC ambiguous — "correct" is undefined or contradictory? | **A-failure** |
| Is it environment: wrong path, missing dependency, permission error, runtime not available? | **E-failure** |

**V-failure (Verifier overstepped):**
Respawn Verifier on the **same provider channel `VP`** as Phase 2 (cross-provider invariant holds across retries — the Verifier stays on the opposite provider from the Worker), with the same prompt, plus:
```
CORRECTION: Your previous test was rejected (V-failure) because it asserted:
  <specific assertion that overstepped>
This is NOT in the Artifact Contract or PFD. Remove it. Test ONLY what is in
the AC's "Expected observable behavior" and "Acceptance emphasis", and the PFD's
"verifier_assertions" and "invariants". Rewrite the test script.
```

**W-failure (Worker missed a requirement):**
Inject the failed Worker's session context:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/session_context.py --agent "<Worker agent description>" --no-thinking
```
Respawn Worker on the **same provider channel `WP`** as Phase 2 (Verifier stays on `VP`, the opposite provider), with the same prompt, plus:
```
CORRECTION: Your implementation failed the Verifier's test (W-failure).

Failed test output:
<paste test stdout/stderr>

Failed assertions:
<list the [FAIL] lines from test output>

Session context from your previous attempt:
<INSERT session_context output>

Fix the implementation. The Verifier's test is the ground truth — do not argue with it.
Implement what it checks.
```

**A-failure (AC ambiguous):**
Stop retry. Output:
```
/go BLOCKED — A-failure: Artifact Contract is ambiguous.

The Verifier's test failed because the AC does not clearly define correct behavior for:
  <specific aspect>

Fix the AC to specify:
  <what needs to be clarified>

Then re-run /go from Phase 1 with the corrected AC.
```
Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress clear`

Remove the .go_active marker:
```bash
rm -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.claude/.go_active"
```

**E-failure (environment issue):**
Fix the environment issue (install missing dep, correct path, fix permissions).
Then re-run Phase 3 only — do NOT respawn Worker or Verifier.

**Retry cap:**
Hard cap: 3 retries total across all categories (V + W + R combined; A and E do not count as retries). R-failures (Phase 3B review HIGH findings) share this budget — a task cannot loop forever between Worker fix and diff review.

After 3 retries, STOP:
```
/go FAILED — 3 retries exhausted.

Attempt history:
  1. <classification> — <what was tried>
  2. <classification> — <what was tried>
  3. <classification> — <what was tried>

Aggregated failure:
<final test output>

Recommended next action: <specific concrete next step — not a question>
```

**Record the KPI outcome (failed run still counts — it is the rework signal):**
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/kpi_rework.py record \
  --task "<short Objective>" --outcome fail_exhausted \
  --worker-spawns <total Worker spawns> --verifier-fails <total test-fail cycles> \
  [--category <defect>:<count> for each classified retry]
```

Run: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/phase.py progress clear`

Remove the .go_active marker:
```bash
rm -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.claude/.go_active"
```

On retry, always include the failed agent's session context (via `session_context.py`) in the new agent's brief so it sees what the predecessor tried and where it got stuck — not Lead's summary.

## [CRITICAL] Non-negotiable constraints

1. **ALL FOUR roles MUST run: Flow Designer → Challenge → Worker + Verifier.** There is no "skip" path inside `/go`.
   If the task is trivial enough to skip Flow Designer, do NOT use `/go` — edit directly.
   (Under SHIP-4 escalation, the Worker+Verifier stage is REPLACED by a `/hackathon` tournament — competing candidates + a deterministic Judge — but Flow Designer and Challenge still precede it, and a test still gates the result. The roles never collapse; only the implementation stage's shape changes.)

2. **Flow Designer → Challenge → Worker + Verifier is a strict order.**
   PFD is an INPUT to the Challenge; the (possibly augmented) PFD is an INPUT to both Worker and Verifier. Spawning Worker or Verifier before the Challenge reconciles = protocol violation.

   **The Challenge MUST run on a different provider than the Flow Designer.** A model cannot find its own blind spots — same-provider "review" is theater. If `get hard` returned a non-anthropic provider, the Challenge is an Opus Agent; if it returned anthropic, the Challenge runs via `codex_worker.sh gpt-5.5`. The Challenge is additive (may add failure modes / directives / assertions, never delete them) and produces NO code — so the exit-code-only PASS axiom is preserved.

3. **Verifier MUST NOT see Worker's prompt or implementation approach.**
   The Verifier's prompt contains ONLY: AC fields (Objective, Artifact path, Expected observable behavior, Acceptance emphasis) + PFD sections (verifier_assertions, invariants, branching_scenarios). Nothing else.
   Independence is the mechanism that prevents self-evaluation bias.

   **The Verifier MUST run on a different provider than the Worker (SHIP-2).** Same-provider verification shares the Worker's blind spots — that is the correlated-failure mode the mono-provider regression introduced. `WP=codex-cli → Verifier=Opus`; `WP=anthropic → Verifier=codex gpt-5.5`. Exactly one of {Worker, Verifier} is anthropic and one is codex-cli. Cross-provider HARDENS the knowledge boundary (it never relaxes it). If the other-provider channel is unavailable, degrade to same-provider and LOG it — this is a quality optimization, not a safety gate, so it must not wedge the pipeline.

4. **Lead MUST NOT evaluate Worker's code quality subjectively.**
   Exit code from Verifier's test = the ONLY verdict mechanism.
   "The code looks correct to me" is never a reason to mark PASS.

5. **Lead MUST run the Verifier's test (Phase 3).**
   Do NOT skip Phase 3. Do NOT infer pass/fail from reading the code.
   The test runs, or the pipeline is incomplete.

6. **Phase 3B diff review (SHIP-3) runs on PASS, on a different provider than the Worker, and produces findings — never code.**
   It is conditional (skipped for a trivial diff, logged) and gated (only after the test is green). A HIGH finding routes to a Worker fix that must re-pass the SAME unchanged test (R-failure, counts toward the retry cap). The reviewer never edits code and never overrides the test verdict — PASS stays "test exit code", never "reviewer approved".
